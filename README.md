🏦 Loan Eligibility Analysis Project

📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes the factors influencing loan approval decisions such as applicant income, education, marital status, employment type, property area, and credit history.
Using Python and Excel, I performed data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover patterns that drive loan eligibility.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Excel: Data cleaning & summary validation

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset Details

Source: Public Loan Dataset (614 rows × 13 columns)

After cleaning, 11 key columns were used for analysis

Derived new column: Overall_Income = ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome

🔍 Key Insights

Applicants with good credit history have the highest approval rate (~79–88%).

Income alone doesn’t guarantee approval — credit reliability and dependents matter more.

Semi-urban applicants show higher approval ratios than rural or urban.

Self-employed individuals tend to receive larger loan amounts, but approvals depend on credit history.

📈 Visualization Summary

Explored income, loan amount, term, and credit history using univariate analysis.

Compared loan status with multiple applicant factors (gender, marital status, education, dependents, employment type).

Highlighted how credit history dominates all other variables in determining approvals.

✅ Conclusion

Credit history is the strongest predictor of loan approval.
Applicants with good credit, moderate loan amounts, and semi-urban backgrounds have the highest approval rates.
The analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can improve fairness and efficiency in lending decisions.
